## Grading Criteria for HR Screen

### 1. Job Alignment & Experience Connection (HIGH PRIORITY)
**What to evaluate:**
- Did they connect their experience to the job requirements?
- Did they mention specific examples that align with the job description?
- Did they identify relevant skills/experience they have?

**What to identify:**
- ✅ **Strengths:** "You mentioned [specific experience] which directly aligns with [job requirement]"
- ❌ **Improvements:** "You have experience with [skill from resume], but didn't mention it when discussing [job requirement]. This would have strengthened your answer."

**Example:**
- Job requires: "Experience managing teams"
- They said: "I've led projects before"
- Feedback: "You mentioned leading projects, which is relevant. Consider being more specific: 'I managed a team of 5 developers on a 6-month project where we...' This directly connects to the team management requirement."

---

### 2. Specificity & Examples (HIGH PRIORITY)
**What to evaluate:**
- Did they give specific examples or just vague statements?
- Did they use concrete details (numbers, timelines, outcomes)?
- Did they tell stories or just list skills?

**What to identify:**
- ✅ **Strengths:** "You provided a specific example: 'In my previous role, I increased sales by 30% over 6 months by...' This shows concrete results."
- ❌ **Improvements:** "When discussing [topic], you mentioned having experience but didn't provide a specific example. Consider preparing a story like: 'In my role at [Company], I [specific action] which resulted in [specific outcome].'"

**Example:**
- They said: "I'm good at problem-solving"
- Better: "I solved a critical production issue by analyzing the root cause, implementing a fix, and reducing downtime by 40%"
- Feedback: "You mentioned problem-solving skills. To strengthen this, prepare a specific example with measurable results."

---

### 3. Resume Consistency & Verification (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**What to evaluate:**
- Do their answers match what's on their resume?
- Are they consistent in their claims?
- Any red flags or discrepancies?

**What to identify:**
- ✅ **Strengths:** "Your answers were consistent with your resume. You accurately described your role at [Company]."
- ❌ **Improvements:** "You mentioned [experience] in the interview but it's not on your resume. Consider adding it, or if it was a mistake, ensure consistency."

---

### 4. Communication Clarity (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**What to evaluate:**
- Were they clear and concise?
- Did they answer questions directly?
- Was their communication professional and appropriate?

**What to identify:**
- ✅ **Strengths:** "You communicated clearly and answered questions directly. Your explanation of [topic] was concise and easy to follow."
- ❌ **Improvements:** "When asked about [topic], your answer was a bit vague. Consider structuring responses: Situation → Action → Result."

---

### 5. Motivation & Interest (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**What to evaluate:**
- Did they show genuine interest in the role?
- Did they ask questions?
- Do they understand what the role entails?

**What to identify:**
- ✅ **Strengths:** "You expressed clear interest in the role and asked thoughtful questions about [topic]."
- ❌ **Improvements:** "You didn't ask any questions about the role. Consider preparing 2-3 questions that show your interest and help you evaluate the opportunity."

---

### 6. Missed Opportunities (HIGH PRIORITY - KEY DIFFERENTIATOR)
**What to evaluate:**
- What relevant experience do they have (from resume) that they DIDN'T mention?
- What job requirements did they not address?
- What connections could they have made but didn't?

**What to identify:**
- ❌ **Missed Opportunities:** "Your resume shows experience with [skill], but you didn't mention it when discussing [job requirement]. This would have been a strong connection to make."
- ❌ **Missed Connections:** "The job requires [requirement]. You have experience with this at [Company] (from your resume), but didn't highlight it. Consider mentioning: '[Specific example from resume that matches requirement].'"

**This is the KEY value-add:** Show them what they should have said but didn't.

## Grading Instructions Template

```
You are evaluating an HR phone screen interview. This is a brief 5-10 minute 
screening call. Your goal is to provide encouraging, actionable feedback that 
helps the candidate improve.

INTERVIEW CONTEXT:
- Stage: HR Phone Screen
- Purpose: Initial screening and basic fit assessment
- Tone: Encouraging but honest (this is a coaching tool, not a harsh evaluation)

YOUR EVALUATION APPROACH:

1. OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
   - Be encouraging: "Based on your qualifications and conversation, we think 
     you're likely to move onto the formal interview process..."
   - Be honest but supportive
   - Frame as "here are tips to strengthen your performance"

2. WHAT THEY DID WELL (Strengths):
   - Identify specific examples they mentioned that align with job requirements
   - Quote what they said: "You mentioned [quote] which directly connects to 
     [job requirement]"
   - Highlight good connections they made between their experience and the role

3. WHAT THEY COULD IMPROVE (Areas for Growth):
   - Identify experience from their resume they SHOULD HAVE mentioned but didn't
   - Point out job requirements they didn't address
   - Show missed connections: "Your resume shows [experience] which aligns with 
     [job requirement], but you didn't mention it. Consider saying: [suggestion]"

4. ACTIONABLE TIPS:
   - Specific suggestions: "When discussing [topic], prepare a story like: 
     [example]"
   - Help them connect their experience to job requirements
   - Guide them on what to mention next time

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

2. COMPARE TO RESUME:
   - Identify relevant experience on their resume
   - Check: Did they mention it in the interview?
   - If NO: This is a missed opportunity - tell them what they should have said

3. BE SPECIFIC:
   - Don't say: "You could improve communication"
   - Do say: "When asked about team management, you said 'I've led teams' but 
     didn't give a specific example. Consider: 'I managed a team of 5 developers 
     on a project where we delivered [outcome]'"

4. BE ENCOURAGING:
   - Frame improvements as opportunities, not failures
   - Use "Consider..." not "You failed to..."
   - Show them the path forward

```

## Example Output

### Overall Assessment
"Based on your qualifications and conversation, we think you're likely to move 
onto the formal interview process. Your experience aligns well with the role, 
and here are some tips to strengthen your performance even further."

### Strengths
1. **Strong Job Alignment:** "You mentioned your experience managing a team of 
   8 developers, which directly aligns with the 'team leadership' requirement. 
   This was a great connection to make."

2. **Specific Examples:** "You provided a concrete example: 'I increased 
   customer satisfaction by 25% by implementing a new feedback system.' This 
   shows measurable results."

3. **Clear Communication:** "You answered questions directly and concisely. 
   Your explanation of your current role was clear and easy to follow."

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Missed Opportunity:** "The job requires 'experience with agile 
   methodologies.' Your resume shows you worked in an agile environment at 
   [Company], but you didn't mention it. Consider saying: 'In my role at 
   [Company], I participated in daily standups and sprint planning, which 
   helped us deliver features 30% faster.'"

2. **Could Be More Specific:** "When discussing problem-solving, you mentioned 
   'solving complex issues' but didn't give a specific example. Consider 
   preparing a story: 'I identified a production bug that was causing 20% 
   downtime. I analyzed the root cause, implemented a fix, and reduced downtime 
   to 2%.'"

3. **Missed Connection:** "The job emphasizes 'customer-focused approach.' You 
   have experience with this (from your resume: 'Managed customer relationships 
   for 50+ clients'), but didn't highlight it. This would have been a strong 
   connection to make."

### Actionable Tips
1. **Prepare Specific Stories:** "For each job requirement, prepare a specific 
   example with: Situation → Action → Result. This makes your experience 
   more tangible."

2. **Connect Resume to Job:** "Review the job description and identify which 
   experiences from your resume align. Make sure to mention these connections 
   during the interview."

3. **Ask Questions:** "You didn't ask any questions. Prepare 2-3 thoughtful 
   questions that show your interest, such as: 'What does success look like in 
   this role in the first 90 days?'"

### Focus on Actionability

- Give specific examples they can use
